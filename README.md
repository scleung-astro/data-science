Storing data science and machine learning python projects

## Introduction
This folder contains some of the recent exercises for my data science
and machine learning projects. The data mostly come from Kaggle,
where I can pick relevant dataset for practices in different 
types of data structure (text, numerical...) and different types
of architecture (regression, neural network...). 

###DS_Diabetes.ipynb
Classification of diabete patients based on exogenous parameters

###DS_Netflix.ipynb
Full analysis on statistical, network and language of the movie and 
tv shows available on NetFlix

###DS_Pfizer.ipynb
Semantic analysis of Tweet's about the vaccine by Pfizer

###DS_Ramen.ipynb
Statistical analysis for instant Ramen available in Amazon

###DS_StockPattern.ipynb
Numerical analysis of stock using indicators

###ML_AndGate.ipynb
Using Artifical Neural Network (ANN) to mimic a logical "AND" gate

###ML_Conv1D_Trend.ipynb
Using Conv1D neural to recognize univariate data pattern

###ML_IntrusionDetection.ipynb
Using ANN to recognize anomalous internet usage pattern

###ML_LSTM_TextGen2b.ipynb
Using LSTM neural network to generate text in the style of 
Andrew Lang, a children literature author

###ML_LSTM_Trend.ipynb
Similar to ML_Conv1D_Trend.ipynb, but I use LSTM network to see
their performance difference

###ML_PetrolPricePrediction.ipynb
I train a LSTM network to study the historical price of different brands of 
petrol and use it to predict the futrue petrol price up to 2022.
